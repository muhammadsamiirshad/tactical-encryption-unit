## üîí Overview

Tactical Encryption Unit is an assembly language program that provides secure communication through various classical encryption algorithms. Developed in Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), this command-line tool offers multiple cipher methods to protect sensitive information.

## üí° Features

- **Multiple Cipher Support**:
  - Caesar Cipher - Shift-based substitution
  - ROT13 - Fixed 13-letter shift variant of Caesar
  - Vigen√®re Cipher - Polyalphabetic substitution using a keyword
  - Custom Substitution - User-defined alphabetic mapping
  - Playfair Cipher - Digraph substitution with 5x5 matrix
  - Monoalphabetic Cipher - Single-key substitution system

- **User-friendly Interface**:
  - Color-coded menus and options
  - Clear visual feedback with boxed results
  - Interactive command-line experience

- **Dual Functionality**: Both encryption and decryption operations supported

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Microsoft Visual Studio with MASM support
- [Irvine32 Library](http://asmirvine.com/) for assembly routines

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tactical-encryption-unit.git
   cd tactical-encryption-unit
   ```

2. **Set up Irvine32 Library**:
   - Download the Irvine library from [http://asmirvine.com/](http://asmirvine.com/)
   - Install it to `C:\Irvine\` (default path used in the project)
   - Alternative: Update the include path in `main.asm` if using a different location

3. **Build the Project**:
   - Open `tactical-encryption-unit.sln` in Visual Studio
   - Build the solution (F7 or Build ‚Üí Build Solution)
   - The executable will be created in the Debug folder

## üöÄ Usage

1. Run the executable (`tactical-encryption-unit.exe`)
2. Select an operation:
   - 1: Encrypt a message
   - 2: Decrypt a message
   - 3: Exit
3. Choose a cipher method (1-6)
4. Enter the text to process and any required parameters (keys, shift values, etc.)
5. View the result and continue with another operation or exit

### Example Operations

#### Caesar Cipher
```
Enter the text: HELLO
Enter the shift value (1-25): 3
Result: KHOOR
```

#### Vigen√®re Cipher
```
Enter the text: TACTICAL
Enter the Vigen√®re keyword: KEY
Result: DIMDGAGP
```

#### Playfair Cipher
```
Enter the text: ASSEMBLY
Enter the Playfair keyword: CIPHER
Result: CMCFQCNS
```

## üìù Technical Details

The project is developed in MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) and utilizes the Irvine32 library for input/output operations. The code implements various encryption algorithms at the assembly level, providing efficient execution and a deeper understanding of how these cryptographic techniques work at the lowest level.
